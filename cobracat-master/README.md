# README

The code in this folder is taken from commit 23c15ee from the repository https://github.com/asilata/cobracat . 
It is used in this repository to compute the morphism spaces between objects obtained via (generalised) braid group actions on a quiver category.
The goal of this calculation is to try and find counterexamples to the faithfulness of various Burau representations.
